# Overview

## Our Thesis

> Follow Smart Money

We believe:
- Aggregating liquidity is the most effective way to achieve better trading depth.
- Stablecoin-centric bridges are the most effective means of achieving cross-chain trading.
- In the era of multi-chain ecology, thousands of assets will be issued on different chains daily.
- With the flourshing of L2 and new mainnet, Web3 is entering the era of "Thousand Chains, One Network".
- Self-custody of assets is becoming the new norm, lowering the barriers to entry for DApps.
- GameFi, SocialFi, and NFTs rode a wave of popular interest in Web3 and a growing mainstream awareness that cryptocurrency is the future.

## Our Solution
