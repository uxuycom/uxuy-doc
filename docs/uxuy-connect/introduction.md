# ü§ù UXUY Connect: The Future of Blockchain Applications

## Introduction

UXUY Connect is an innovative ecosystem designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology with instant messaging platforms. Our mission is to redefine how users interact with blockchain applications, creating unprecedented opportunities for developers, public chains, and users alike.

:::caution
UXUY TG Wallet no longer supports non-Ton Connect. DApp projects using EVM, Solana, or Tron Connect should upgrade promptly.

## Technical Overview

UXUY Connect leverages cutting-edge technology to bridge the gap between blockchain applications and mainstream users:

1. **Blockchain Integration**:
    - Supports multiple EVM-compatible chains, including BNB Chain
    - Provides a unified interface for interacting with various blockchain networks

2. **MiniApp Framework**:
    - Converts DApps into Telegram-compatible MiniApps
    - Offers a streamlined development process with reusable components

3. **Smart Contract Interaction**:
    - Enables seamless interaction with smart contracts directly from the Telegram interface
    - Supports various transaction types, including token transfers and contract calls

4. **Decentralized Identity (DID)**:
    - Implements a robust DID system for user authentication and authorization
    - Ensures privacy and security while enabling cross-platform identity management

5. **State Channels**:
    - Utilizes state channel technology for instant, off-chain transactions
    - Reduces blockchain congestion and improves user experience

## Key Features

1. **Massive User Base**:
    - Direct access to millions of Telegram users
