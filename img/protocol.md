# The protocol highlights

Our goal is to enhance your cryptocurrency trading experience by providing a secure, profitable, and intelligent protocol, allowing easy access to mixed cross-chain liquidity in one place.

To offer users the most convenient and expedited cross-chain exchange process, UXUY provides Swap, U Pool, API, and pre-built widgets. Our protocol, centered around stablecoins, aims to enable users to securely access mixed cross-chain liquidity on a single platform. Whether you are a trader, investor, or liquidity provider, our protocol offers you the flexibility to execute transactions quickly and seamlessly across multiple blockchains.

With UXUY, cross-chain exchanges are lightning-fast and effortless. You can trade any token at any time without worrying about liquidity fragmentation. Our liquidity aggregation feature allows you to access liquidity from multiple sources and execute transactions at the most competitive prices. This ensures you get the best possible trading prices and helps you maximize profits.

We understand that integration can be a challenge for many platforms. That's why we make it easy for you to integrate UXUY with your existing website and DApps. Our API provides the freedom of custom UI while offering the powerful functionality of the UXUY protocol, making it easy to build your custom integrations. We also provide pre-built widgets that you can seamlessly embed into your website or application to offer your users a frictionless trading experience.

At UXUY, security is our top priority. We have implemented the latest security measures to protect your funds and personal information. Our protocol is non-custodial, meaning you always retain full control over your assets. Our smart contract technology ensures that all transactions are executed transparently and securely without the need for intermediaries.

## Stablecoin-Centric

By leveraging stablecoin-based bridges, UXUY enables transactions between any cryptocurrency pairs.

We believe that stablecoin-centric bridges are the most efficient means to achieve cross-chain transactions. Therefore, we are building the U Pool product, which is a stablecoin-centric bridge, maintaining an efficient cross-chain liquidity pool as the cornerstone of the UXUY protocol.

## Cross-Chain

The UXUY protocol supports multiple chains, including but not limited to Ethereum mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and Tron. We are continuously expanding our supported chains.

At UXUY, we firmly believe in the potential of multi-chain solutions. We anticipate that thousands of assets will be issued on different chains every day in the future. By providing a reliable and secure protocol that supports a wide range of chains, we enable you to access a broader choice of assets and harness the explosive growth of decentralized finance. Experience the power of UXUY and prepare your crypto ventures for the upcoming era of multi-chain.

# Liquidity Aggregation

UXUY is an interoperability protocol with a trend of aggregating DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) and bridges. UXUY scans all possible routes and finds you the best deal at the most favorable price.

Aggregating liquidity is the most efficient way to achieve better trading depth. At UXUY, we are committed to continually adding new liquidity providers on all blockchain networks to ensure we offer the best trading routes for our users. The UXUY protocol aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXs, including but not limited to Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, and SunSwap.
