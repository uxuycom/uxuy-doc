DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Terms of Service","url":"/uxuy-docsite/term-of-service/#11-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration","content":"Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with UXUY and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. You and UXUY agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and UXUY and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Except for small claims disputes in which you or UXUY seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside or disputes in which you or UXUY seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and UXUY waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against UXUY or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact UXUY and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to UXUY by email at legal@uxuy.com. The Notice must include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number, describe the nature and basis of the claim, and set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and UXUY cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the JAMS, or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in California, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS Site and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. You and UXUY agree that the enforceability of this Section 11 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. The arbitrator, UXUY, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the disputes. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. You and UXUY agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and UXUY will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by UXUY, UXUY will pay all AAA fees and costs. You and UXUY agree that the courts of Germany have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and UXUY will not have the right to assert the claim. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 11 by emailing us at legal@uxuy.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt-out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 11. If any portion of this Section 11 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms, severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 11 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 11, and to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will stay pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 11 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 11 will be enforceable. "},{"title":"12. GOVERNING LAW​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Terms of Service","url":"/uxuy-docsite/term-of-service/#12--governing-law","content":"The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Site, or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Germany, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in Germany will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts. "},{"title":"13. MISCELLANEOUS​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Terms of Service","url":"/uxuy-docsite/term-of-service/#13-miscellaneous","content":"Any right or remedy of UXUY set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law or in equity. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Site or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction.

We may assign or transfer any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without notice or obtaining your consent or approval. Headings of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections. These Terms contain the entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Site and the Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement supersedes these Terms.
