We can make the following comparison: Physical Gold: You need a secure place to store it, such as a safe deposit box at a bank.Bitcoin: This 'digital gold' is stored in a 'digital wallet,' which is a program on the internet that secures your Bitcoin. Remember, although Bitcoin is a digital asset, it is not backed by any bank or government. Therefore, its value mainly depends on the trust and demand people have for it. Similarly, it does not become useless due to bank failures or the collapse of governments. BTC has the following characteristics: Limited Supply: The total supply of Bitcoin is capped, with the protocol designed to limit the issuance to a maximum of 21 million BTC.Cross-Border Payments: Bitcoin enables users to send and receive funds quickly and at a low cost, across borders, without the need for traditional banking systems.Investment Asset: Many people also consider Bitcoin as an investment asset. When it was first introduced in 2008, it was virtually worthless, with its price being less than $0.01. Over the years, Bitcoin has experienced significant growth and adoption, and as of now, it has reached a value of over 60,000 per BTC.","keywords":"uxuy  dex  wallet  web3  crypto"},{"title":"Welcome to UXUY","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/tg-lightning-wallet/import-wallet-already-one/","content":"Welcome to UXUY No, currently we do not support the import feature for wallets from other services.

Imagine the Bitcoin blockchain is like a busy highway where all the cars (transactions) have to travel. When the traffic (number of transactions) gets heavy, there's a jam, and the cars move slowly. Plus, each car (transaction) has to pay a toll (transaction fee). Now, the Lightning Network is like a set of side roads or alleys built to help with this traffic. Not all cars need to be on the main highway. Some can take these side roads, which allows them to quickly move from one place to another without the main highway's congestion and without having to pay a toll. In this analogy: The main highway represents the main Bitcoin blockchain.The side roads or alleys represent Lightning Network payment channels.The cars represent transactions.The tolls represent transaction fees. By using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin users can 'take the side roads,' meaning they can make transactions quickly and at a low cost without having to go through the main Bitcoin blockchain every time. This makes small payments more practical and efficient.","keywords":"uxuy  dex  wallet  web3  crypto"},{"title":"Terms of Service","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/term-of-service/","content":"","keywords":"uxuy  dex  wallet  web3  crypto"},{"title":"1.

In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. You and UXUY agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and UXUY and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Except for small claims disputes in which you or UXUY seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside or disputes in which you or UXUY seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and UXUY waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against UXUY or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact UXUY and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (‚ÄúNotice‚Äù) to UXUY by email at legal@uxuy.com. The Notice must include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number, describe the nature and basis of the claim, and set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and UXUY cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the JAMS, or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in California, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (‚ÄúJAMS Rules‚Äù). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS Site and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. You and UXUY agree that the enforceability of this Section 11 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ¬ß 1, et seq. (the ‚ÄúFAA‚Äù), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual‚Äôs claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. The arbitrator, UXUY, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the disputes. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. You and UXUY agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and UXUY will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by UXUY, UXUY will pay all AAA fees and costs. You and UXUY agree that the courts of Germany have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and UXUY will not have the right to assert the claim. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 11 by emailing us at legal@uxuy.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt-out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 11.
